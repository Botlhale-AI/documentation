## Create a Chatbot
 
The Chatbots page displays all the bots in the system. 
So, to create a new bot, you first click on the `CREATE BOT` button as shown in Figure 1.

Once you have clicked the create bot button, you will be prompted to enter the Bot name and select the language(s) that the bot should support then click on the `Save bot` button to save the newly created bot.


## Chatbot list
 
The newly created bot will be added to the My Chatbots list on the dashboard. You can select between different bots by clicking the Chatbot drop down menu in the top right-hand  corner of the page.

Once the bot has been created, click on the edit icon to add the Bot builder parameters such as Intents, Entities and/or Dialogue. These are discussed in detail in the Bot Builder section.

## Import a chatbot

To help you get accustomed to using the platform a little faster, we have created a few template bots that you can import onto your dashboard. These bots show the platform's functionality to varying extents. To import a template bot, simply click on one of the `IMPORT BOT` buttons and the relevant bot will be imported onto your dashboard. The template bots can be edited and deleted just like any other bot that has been created. When a template bot is deleted, you have the option import it onto your dashboard again. Please note however, that all of the edits that were made on the bot will be lost.
