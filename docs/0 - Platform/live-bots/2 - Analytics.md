# Analytics

Botlhale AI makes available to you analytics on your deployed chatbots. This information can be accessed on the Analytics page of the Botlhale NLP Toolkit Platform by navigating to **Live Bots > Analytics**. From here, you can view various performance metrics for your chatbot such as the completion rate, fallback rate, handoff rate, bot confidence, and so much more.

To view your reports, ensure you have selected the deployed chatbot whose performance you wish to see. You can do this via the dropdown menu on the top-right corner of your screen.
