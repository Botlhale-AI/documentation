# Train

This section outlines the procedure for training a chatbot with the intents and user examples provided in the previous sections. Training is done with a dataset which comprises many sentences organised into intents. This represents what users say to a chatbot. The training dataset teaches the chatbot to understand a user's needs and trigger the right conversation sequence.

Use the following steps to train your chatbot.

1. Ensure the chatbot you wish to train is selected. Use the dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the Botlhale NLP Toolkit site to toggle between chatbots.
2. Navigate to the Training Dashboard.
