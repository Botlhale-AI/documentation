# Test

This section outlines the procedures for testing your chatbot once it's been created and trained. 

:::tip
> It's recommended that you open the Test page in a new Tab or Window should you want to browse through the app while you test your chatbot. Leaving the Test page while testing is ongoing will require you to reload the model.
:::

<!--You have the option of performing a Quick Test or a Telegram Test for your chatbot. Quick Tests happen within the Botlhale NLP Toolkit platform. With Telegram Tests, you need to have an existing Telegram portal to which to deploy the test. The following subsections outline the procedures for both tests.-->

## Quick Test

Use the following steps to perform a Quick Test on your chatbot.

1. On the Testing Dashboard, ensure the Quick Test tab is selected.
2. Enter the Model Parameters for your Quick Test. This is the language and model (trained chatbot) you wish to test.

   > Like with training, you can only test one model and language at a time.
   :::

3. Click the `Load Model` button.

4. Once your model is loaded, a message from your chatbot appears on the Chat Interface, and you can begin interacting with the chatbot.
