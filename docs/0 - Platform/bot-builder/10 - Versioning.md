# Versioning

Botlhale's NLP Toolkit platform offers versioning capabilities for your chatbots. This gives you the ability to manage and control different versions or iterations of your chatbot, enabling you to manage the evolution of your bot over time.

You can create a new version of your chatbot from any of the following pages on the platform:

- [Intents Manager](https://app.botlhale.xyz/intents_manager)
- [FAQs Manager](https://app.botlhale.xyz/faq_manager)
- [Entities Manager](https://app.botlhale.xyz/entities_manager)
- [Dialogue Manager](https://app.botlhale.xyz/dialogue_manager)

To create a new chatbot version:

1. From any of the pages previously listed, click the `Save New Version` button that features on the top-right corner.
2. A pop-up window appears, prompting you to name your version.
3. Enter your desired version name and click `Create version`.
4. Your new chatbot version is created.
