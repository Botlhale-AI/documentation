## Create a Chatbot

Once you have successfully logged in to the Botlhale NLP Toolkit site and selected your organisation, you can begin creating your chatbot.

:::info Only users with admin and botbuilder permissions are able to create bots on this platform. :::

Use the following steps to create your chatbot.

1. Click on the `CREATE BOT` button as shown in the following image.

2. A pop-up window appears, prompting you to name your new bot and select one or more languages the bot will support. Fill in the required fields and click `Create bot`.

## Chatbot list
 
The newly created bot is added to the My Chatbots list on the dashboard. You can toggle between different bots by clicking the Chatbot dropdown menu in the top right-hand corner of the page.

Once the bot has been created, click on the edit icon to add the Bot builder parameters such as Intents, Entities and/or Dialogue. These are discussed in detail in the Bot Builder section.

## Import a chatbot

To help you get accustomed to using the platform a little faster, we have created a few template bots that you can import onto your dashboard. These bots show the platform's functionality to varying extents. To import a template bot, simply click on one of the `IMPORT BOT` buttons and the relevant bot will be imported onto your dashboard. The template bots can be edited and deleted just like any other bot that has been created. When a template bot is deleted, you have the option import it onto your dashboard again. Please note however, that all of the edits that were made on the bot will be lost.
