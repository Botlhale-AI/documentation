# Queue

Customers transferred to a human agent by the chatbot are placed in a queue. From here, they get assigned to an agent for a live chat. These assignments can happen automatically or manually. Automatic assigning is configured on the Queue Management interface. See the [Queue Management](https://docs.botlhale.xyz/docs/Platform/help-desk/Queue%20Management) section of this documentation for more information on this. 

If automatic assigning is not enabled, transferred users must be manually assigned to an agent. With this process, agents get notified each time a new user is transferred by the chatbot. They must then manually assign a user to themselves via the Live Chat page by clicking the Assign icon.
