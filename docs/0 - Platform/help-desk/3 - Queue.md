# Queue

Customers transferred to a human agent by the chatbot can be added to the queue manually or automatically. Automatic queue assigning is configured on the Queue Management interface. See the [Queue Management](https://docs.botlhale.xyz/docs/Platform/help-desk/Queue%20Management) section of this documentation for more information on this. 

If automatic queue assigning is not enabled, users must be manually added to the queue. With this process, agents get notified each time a new user is transferred by the chatbot. They must then manually assign a user to themselves via the Live Chat page by clicking the Assign icon.
