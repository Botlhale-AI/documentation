## Queue Management

Queue management is a crucial aspect of running a successful business, especially in the service industry. A queue management system allows you to effectively manage customer flow, minimize wait times, and provide an efficient service experience. With our queue management system, you can assign virtual tickets to customers, track their place in the queue, and display wait times in real-time. This information can be accessed from anywhere, allowing you to manage your queue even when you're on the go. A queue management system helps to eliminate the need for manual queue management and reduces wait times, providing a more enjoyable experience for your customers and improving the overall efficiency of your business.

Understanding the nature of traffic and queries, this section of the platform allows you to set how the queue of your incoming customers and manage how the workload is distributed among your organisation's agents.
