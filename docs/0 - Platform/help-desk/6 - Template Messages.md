# Template Messages

Template messages are used to open marketing, utility, and authentication conversations with customers via Meta's WhatsApp Business Platform. This is the only type of message that can be sent to customers who have yet to message you, or who have not sent you a message in the last 24 hours.

Template messages incur fees set by Meta. They must also be approved by Meta before they can be sent to customers. For more information about template message pricing and approvals, see the [Meta for Developers documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/).

Botlhale AI uses 360 Dialog, a third party, to manage template messages for Meta's WhatsApp Business Platform. For more information about managing template messages, see the [360 Dialog documentation](https://docs.360dialog.com/docs/360-client-hub/template-management-ui).

Botlhale AI's NLP Toolkit platform allows you to create, view and manage template messages on the Template Messages interface. This is accessible by navigating to **Botlhale NLP Toolkit > Help Desk > Template Messages**. The following image gives you a view of the Template Messages interface.

To view the details of an existing template message, simply click the View icon next to the message you wish to see.

To delete an existing template message, simply click the Delete icon next to the message you wish to delete. Note that this action is final and cannot be rolled back.

To create a new template message:

1. Click on the `Create Template` button.
2. A pop-up window, illustrated in the image that follows, appears, prompting you to enter the information for the new template message.

3. Enter the requested information and click `Submit Template`.
4. Your template message is created and submitted for approval. You can track the progress of your message approval via the Status bar of the Template Messages interface. 

Once your message has been created and approved, you can begin sending it to your customers. This is done on the Proactive Messaging interface. For more information on this, see the [Proactive Messaging](https://docs.botlhale.xyz/docs/Platform/help-desk/Proactive%20Messaging) section of this documentation.
