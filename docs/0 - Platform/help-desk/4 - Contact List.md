# Contact List

Botlhale AI's platform allows you to maintain a database of your clients via the Contact List page. A well-organised contact list can be a valuable asset for any business, allowing you to improve your sales and marketing efforts, provide better customer service, and make better business decisions. 

When your chatbot executes a human handoff, the end user's name, number, and email address are extracted from the conversation and automatically logged in your organisation's contact list. This is shown in the following image.

You also have the option of adding contacts to your list manually. There are two ways of executing manual additions to your contact list. You can either add single users, or upload an existing contact list to the platform.

1. From the Contact List page of Botlhale NLP Toolkit platform, click the `New Contact` button.
