# Live Chats 

This section covers interactions between the human (an agent) and the customer (end user), triggered after the human handover function is activated on the chatbot by the customer. Agents can access their live chats by navigating to **Help Desk > Live Chats** on the Botlhale NLP Toolkit site. The Live Chats interface is illustrated in the following image.

> Agents can use the arrows next to the `Translate Conversations` tab to select their preferred language for the live chat. If the agent's interlocutor is conversing in a different language, the messages are translated in real-time.
