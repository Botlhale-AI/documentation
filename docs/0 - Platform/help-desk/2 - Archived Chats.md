# Archived Chats

After a 24-hour period of inactivity, live chats on WhatsApp get automatically archived. These archived chats can be accessed by navigating to **Help Desk > Archived Chats** from the Botlhale NLP Toolkit homepage. 

You have the option of restarting an archived chat by sending a pre-approved template message. Please note that WhatsApp charges a fee to send Template Messages to archived chats. For more information on template messaging and its associated pricing, see the [Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/conversation-types) section of Meta's WhatsApp Business Plaform documentation. For information on creating and managing template messages within the Botlhale AI platform, see the [Template Messages](https://app.botlhale.xyz/template_messages) section of this documentation.
