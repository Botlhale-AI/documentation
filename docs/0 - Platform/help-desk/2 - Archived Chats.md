# Archived Chats

After a 24-hour period of inactivity, live chats on WhatsApp get automatically archived. While you can view the conversations from an archived chat, you cannot send messages to a user once their chat has been archived. These archived chats can be accessed by navigating to **Help Desk > Archived Chats** from the Botlhale NLP Toolkit homepage. The following screenshot gives you a view of the Archived Chats interface.

## Restart an Archived Chat

You have the option of restarting an archived chat by sending a preapproved template message. Please note that WhatsApp charges a fee to send Template Messages to archived chats. For more information on template messaging and its associated pricing, see the [Messages](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/conversation-types) section of Meta's WhatsApp Business Plaform documentation. For information on creating and managing template messages within the Botlhale AI platform, see the [Template Messages](https://app.botlhale.xyz/template_messages) section of this documentation.

3. Click on the Template Message icon to the right of the message bar.
