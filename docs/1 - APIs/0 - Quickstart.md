# Quickstart Guide

Botlhale AI's APIs are organised around REST. Our APIs have predictable resource-oriented URLs; accept form-encoded request bodies; return JSON-encoded responses; and use standard HTTP response codes and authentication. See the [Response Codes](2%20-%20Errors.md) and [Authentication](1%20-%20Authentication.md) sections of this documentation for additional information.
